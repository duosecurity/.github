# Issues and Pull Requests
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our repositories, please do not submit an issue on the repository.  Instead please follow our [Security Response guidelines](https://duo.com/support/security-and-reliability/security-response) by emailing psirt@cisco.com with a summary of the vulnerability.

Otherwise we encourage you to submit an issue or pull request to the repository, though please check if an issue has already been created on the same subject.

We will do our best to review issues and pull requests, but you can help us out by
- including thorough testing for any code changes
- creating an issue to discuss any major changes (like framework migrations or significant features) before submitting a PR
- conforming to the code style of the repository

# Licensing
In general, code submissions are subject to the same licensing terms as outlined in the repository's license file.  If this is a concern, please first create an issue to contact us.
